# Elisa User Manual

Elisa is a visual programming tool where you snap together blocks to describe what you want to build, then AI agents build it for you. It is designed for kids (10+) and adults who are new to programming.

You design your project with blocks, press GO, and watch your team of AI minions plan tasks, write code, run tests, and deploy -- all in real time.
